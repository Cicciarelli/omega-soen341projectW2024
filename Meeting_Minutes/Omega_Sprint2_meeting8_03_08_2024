Meeting Minutes - March 8th, 2024 - 4 hours

Liam, Daniel, Maxime and Maria met on March 8th in the library at 12pm until 4pm to discuss finalization of sprint 2. 

For 3.5 hours, we all worked on the implementation of each core feature individually, and throughout these 2 hours we
helped each other with any issues we were facing, notably mismatching URLs and using the same ones throughout the whole application.

For 30minutes, we talked about the rubric and what we wanted to change before submission, we talked about the tasks we had left and divided the work to finish.

For next meeting, we will discuss how to implement the new user stories.
