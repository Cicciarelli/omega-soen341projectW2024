Meeting Minutes - March 27th, 2024 - 2 hours

Liam, Daniel, Maxime, Matthew and Maria met on March 27th on Discord for 2 hours.

Following the submission of Sprint 3, it is now time to start working on Sprint 4. The first thing we did in this meeting was go over the Sprint 4
instructions all together. The most prominent part of this sprint is the introduction of a new feature. We decided that the new feature we would
implement would be a rating system for customers. So once checked out, a user will have the option to leave a rating out of 5 stars and a written 
review. We divided this User Story into the following tasks:

                    -Create a button that redirects to review and rating page #327
                    -Create a page with a form containing a form for leaving a review, as well as a list of reviews left by previous customers. #329
                    -Create a Review List to display in review page #330
                    -Create a Star-Based Rating system #332
                    -Create a function to leave 0 to 5 stars on a review #334

We assigned Max to #327, Matthew to #329, Maria to #330, Daniel to #332 and Liam to #334.

Also, in the sprint instructions, we saw that we had to reorganize our code and our naming conventions for our files. We decided to do this after
we got all the features working, because we wanted to be sure the code ran properly before committing time to organization. 

Finally, we saw that we had to do code review for each others codes. Again, we decided to only focus on this once the entire project has been 
completed because we want to prioritize the functionality of the project first.

For our next meeting, we want the feature to be implemented so we can begin to focus on the next parts of the sprint. We will discuss the 
implementation, if all was done correctly, and then begin to plan for the organization and review components of the sprint.
