Discord meeting

2024-03-10

1:00pm to 4:00pm

Topics of discussion:

1) assigning all HTML URLs so that the home page has links to all HTML pages
2) creating reservation, vehicle and user models

These topics were discussed in depth and many troubleshooting occurred. We encountered issues with implementation
of the html pages but we found solutions.
