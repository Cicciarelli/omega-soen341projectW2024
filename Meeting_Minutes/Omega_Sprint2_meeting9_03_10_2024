Meeting Minutes - March 10th, 2024 - 3 hours

Liam, Daniel, Maxime, Maria and Matthew met on March 10th on Discord at 1pm until 4pm.

For an hour and a half, we created and named all the URLs in the django file. We then updated all the URLs across all the HTML templates so that everything was
linked properly.
For an hour and half, we discussed creating reservation, vehicle and user models with the django framework.

For next meeting, we will discuss Sprint 3.
