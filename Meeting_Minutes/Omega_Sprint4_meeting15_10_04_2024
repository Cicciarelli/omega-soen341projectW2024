Meeting Minutes - April 10th, 2024 - 3 hours

Liam, Daniel, Maxime, Matthew and Maria met on April 10th on Discord for 3 hours.

This is our final meeting for this project. Upon discussing what we've all worked on, we see that the forum is completed and working great. The
project still has a few other kinks, for example the map API not working as smoothly as we'd hoped, so we're working on different things while on
call. Maria continues to work on the repository's organization. Daniel works on the meeting minutes files. Matthew and Maxime are working on the 
SonarCloud, and Liam is fixing all the bugs we've found while going through the project. Once SonarCloud is working, we will all use it to review 
each other's code. The project is due today, so after this Sprint we do not have anything else to work on for the car rentak website.
