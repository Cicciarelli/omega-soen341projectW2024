**Description of the project**

In this project, we are tasked with creating a car rental application that will facilitate the process of renting vehicles for short periods, ranging from a few hours to a few weeks. Through this project, our team members will get to experience firsthand how a software project is managed using Github.


**Team Members and Roles**

Software Engineering Undergraduate(s):

_Daniel Cicciarelli,_
_Liam Halpin,_
_Maria Shanoudy-Farhood,_
_Matthew Kazemie_

As the name implies, software engineering focuses on the design of software applications and programs. These team members are the backbone of this project as they are most familiar with software applications and have had experience in both front end and back end development.

Computer Engineering Undergraduate(s):
_Maxime Pag√©_

Computer engineering is a mix of software engineering and of hardware engineering. Although less experienced with software design, this team member is knowledgeable in many programming languages that will provide support to the other team members. 


**Project Approach and Technology**

1. Project Overview
 
 1.1 Project Objectives
- Clearly define the goals and objectives of the project.
- Goal of this project is to create a functioning (semi-functioning) web application prototype to facilitate the process of renting vehicles.
- Objectives:
- Have a functioning web page; includes a full catalogue of cars, a "payment method", a sign in/create account page, a "create reservation" page, and any other tools necessary in a web page nowadays
