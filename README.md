**Description of the project**

In this project, we are tasked with creating a car rental application that will facilitate the process of renting vehicles for short periods, ranging from a few hours to a few weeks. Through this project, our team members will get to experience firsthand how a software project is managed using Github.


**Team Members and Roles**

Software Engineering Undergraduate(s):

_Daniel Cicciarelli,_
_Liam Halpin,_
_Maria Shanoudy-Farhood,_
_Matthew Kazemie_

As the name implies, software engineering focuses on the design of software applications and programs. These team members are the backbone of this project as they are most familiar with software applications and have had experience in both front end and back end development.

Computer Engineering Undergraduate(s):
_Maxime Pag√©_

Computer engineering is a mix of software engineering and of hardware engineering. Although less experienced with software design, this team member is knowledgeable in many programming languages that will provide support to the other team members. 


**Project Approach and Technology**

1. Project Overview
 
 1.1 Project Objectives

  The goal of this project is to create a web application prototype or base for a car rental project. Users of this application can create accounts,
  browse vehicles, make reservations and modify/delete account or reservation specifics. This needs to be created using GitHub as a repository for our
  code and documentation.

 
 1.2 Scope

  This project will be a functioning web page. Users will be able to sign in or create a new account. With an account, users will to make a reservation. If 
  a user has an existing reservation, they will be able to view, modify and delete that reservation. If a user has an account, they will be able to view,
  modify and delete their account. They will be able to change passwords and change usernames (if the new username does not already exist).

  The website itself will consist of a home page with a list of available vehicles. Filters will be available to narrow down a users search. On the home
  page, there will be brief details on the cars. Selecting a car will bring the user to a new page with more details on the car, as well as the option to
  reserve the car. A database will store users, cars and reservations.

  System administators will be able to view, modify, and delete any existing user. They will be available to view, modify, and delete any existing
  reservation. They will also be available to view, modify and delete any existing car. System administrators will also be able to add new cars, new users
  and new reservations.

  Users will be able to review and rate the service, (ratings will also be stored in a database), and select a pickup location for certain cars.
 
 1.3 Target Audience
 
  We are looking to have two target audiences. Firstly, we are looking to target travellers to Montreal who are in need of a car to get around while they
  are here. Secondly, we are looking to target either travellers or natives who want to rent a luxury car for a shorter period of time. Of course, any 
  user must be 23 years old or older to rent a car.
 
 2. Project Approach
 
 2.1 Development Methodology
- Choose a development methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) and
justify the selection based on project requirements.
 
 2.2 Project Timeline
- Create a high-level timeline outlining major milestones and
deadlines.
 
 2.3 Collaboration and Communication

 Our team will be using Discord for the majority of our communication. We will be meeting in person at least once per week, but for the most part Discord
 calls and messages will be used.
 
 3. Technology Stack
 
 3.1 Backend Frameworks
 
 3.1.1 Flask
- Description: : Flask is a lightweight and versatile web development framework for Python. It is simple and easy to use for beginners which makes it a good option to create prototypes for smaller web sites.
- Rationale:
  Flask is simple to use and flexible making it easy for beginners to use and create a website from it during their first-time use. It is also a minimalistic web development frame when it comes to its web design. Flask comes with its own pros and cons that can change how you plan to create your website. A great thing about Flask is that it has a large and active community that and can help with any questions or difficulties that you may encounter while using Flask. There are a lot of tutorials on how to use flask on YouTube as well as websites to teach the different functions that are offered by flask. Flask can also be integrated with Python which is our backend language of choice. This can give us access to python libraries and framework. These libraries and frameworks give us access to some features that can simplify our workload for the creation of our website such as database management.
scalability, and ease of integration.
- Qualitative Assessment:
  Strengths: Flask's has more of a minimalist design while also containing beginner-friendly API which make it easy to learn and use for beginners and first-time users. In Flask, you can access libraries of different back-end languages such as python which offers a lot more options for website design, management, and creation. Flask also has a small codebase compared to other frameworks which makes it more dependable than others and great for creating web site prototypes quickly as well as for making quick overhauls.
