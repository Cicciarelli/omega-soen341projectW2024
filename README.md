**Description of the project**

In this project, we are tasked with creating a car rental application that will facilitate the process of renting vehicles for short periods, ranging from a few hours to a few weeks. Through this project, our team members will get to experience firsthand how a software project is managed using Github.


**Team Members and Roles**

Software Engineering Undergraduate(s):

_Daniel Cicciarelli,_
_Liam Halpin,_
_Maria Shanoudy-Farhood,_
_Matthew Kazemie_

As the name implies, software engineering focuses on the design of software applications and programs. These team members are the backbone of this project as they are most familiar with software applications and have had experience in both front end and back end development.

Computer Engineering Undergraduate(s):
_Maxime Pag√©_

Computer engineering is a mix of software engineering and of hardware engineering. Although less experienced with software design, this team member is knowledgeable in many programming languages that will provide support to the other team members. 


**Project Approach and Technology**

1. Project Overview
 
 1.1 Project Objectives

  The goal of this project is to create a web application prototype or base for a car rental project. Users of this application can create accounts,
  browse vehicles, make reservations and modify/delete account or reservation specifics. This needs to be created using GitHub as a repository for our
  code and documentation.

 
 1.2 Scope

  This project will be a functioning web page. Users will be able to sign in or create a new account. With an account, users will to make a reservation. If 
  a user has an existing reservation, they will be able to view, modify and delete that reservation. If a user has an account, they will be able to view,
  modify and delete their account. They will be able to change passwords and change usernames (if the new username does not already exist).

  The website itself will consist of a home page with a list of available vehicles. Filters will be available to narrow down a users search. On the home
  page, there will be brief details on the cars. Selecting a car will bring the user to a new page with more details on the car, as well as the option to
  reserve the car. A database will store users, cars and reservations.

  System administators will be able to view, modify, and delete any existing user. They will be available to view, modify, and delete any existing
  reservation. They will also be available to view, modify and delete any existing car. System administrators will also be able to add new cars, new users
  and new reservations.

  Users will be able to review and rate the service, (ratings will also be stored in a database), and select a pickup location for certain cars.
 
 1.3 Target Audience
 
  We are looking to have two target audiences. Firstly, we are looking to target travellers to Montreal who are in need of a car to get around while they
  are here. Secondly, we are looking to target either travellers or locals who want to rent a luxury car for a shorter period of time. Of course, any 
  user must be 23 years old or older to rent a car.
 
 2. Project Approach
 
 2.1 Development Methodology
- Choose a development methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) and
justify the selection based on project requirements.
 
 2.2 Project Timeline
- Create a high-level timeline outlining major milestones and
deadlines.
 
 2.3 Collaboration and Communication

 Our team will be using Discord for the majority of our communication and using Github for the code and the seperation of tasks. We will also be meeting in person at least once per week.
 calls and messages will be used.
 
 3. Technology Stack
 
 3.1 Backend Frameworks
 
 3.1.1 Framework A
- Description: Brief overview of Framework A.
- Rationale:
  - Justification for choosing Framework A.
  - Consider factors such as community support,
scalability, and ease of integration.
- Qualitative Assessment:
  - Strengths
  - Weaknesses
  - Use Cases
 
 3.1.2 Framework B
- Description: Brief overview of Framework B.
- Rationale:
  - Justification for choosing Framework B.
  - Consider factors such as performance, security, and
maintenance.
- Qualitative Assessment:
  - Strengths
  - Weaknesses
  - Use Cases
 
 3.1.3 Framework C
- Description: Brief overview of Framework C.
- Rationale:
  - Justification for choosing Framework C.
  - Consider factors such as community support, learning
curve, and extensibility.
- Qualitative Assessment:
  - Strengths
  - Weaknesses
  - Use Cases
 
 3.2 Frontend Frameworks
 
 3.2.1 Framework X
- Description: Brief overview of Framework X.
- Rationale:
  - Justification for choosing Framework X.
  - Consider factors such as user interface
capabilities, responsiveness, and cross-browser compatibility.
- Qualitative Assessment:
  - Strengths
  - Weaknesses
  - Use Cases
 
 3.2.2 Framework React.js
 
React.js is a JavaScript library for building interactive UIs (User Interface), and it was initially developed at Facebook to fix code maintainability issues. It utilized what are called "components" to make applications. These components are pieces of the UI that are fully programmable and which range from a simple button to the entire page.

First and foremost, many applications that people use in their daily lives are developed with React: notably, we have Facebook, Instragram, Netflix, NY Times, Yahoo! and even Khan Academy.
Secondly, React.js is considered the best frontend framework by many articles online, as well as reviewers who said they are more likely to re-use React.js than any other frameworks.
The components aforementioned are easily reusabable and the integrated React hooks makes writing them easy.
It should also be mentioned that React.js has an incredibly large support community as it is used for the largest social media apps.
 
In other words, React.js comes with very practical tools, such as components and hooks. The large community support is a key part of considering a framework as any problem we encounter might have already been solved.
However, React.js has a steep learning curve and it could be difficult for those with little to no knowledge of javascript to learn how to use it.
In terms of use cases, React.js is a perfect match for a single-page web application (take Facebook for example).
 
 3.2.3 Framework Z
